### Project

Created as work of the Database I and Database II taught by Dr. Nilceu Marana, from SÃ£o Paulo State University - UNESP.

A database model should be produced and then model it and put at least in the 3rd normal form and create a friendly interface for data insertion, removal and modification.

I chose to create the API using its own framework, [Midori] (https://github.com/modscleo4/midori), which is a framework for API creation.
